# Task Manager (Lakers Edition)

This is a simple Java-based task management application with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows you to:

*   Add tasks with a title and description.
*   View your list of tasks.
*   Mark tasks as complete.

## How to Run

1.  **Make sure you have Java installed:** You'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run this.
2.  **Compile:** Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run:
    ```bash
    javac TaskManagerGUI.java
    ```
3.  **Run:** After compiling, execute:
    ```bash
    java TaskManagerGUI
    ```
    A window should pop up â€“ that's your task manager!

## How to Use

1.  **Add a Task:**
    *   Type the task's title in the "Task Title" field.
    *   Add a description in the "Description" field (optional).
    *   Click the "Add Task" button.

2.  **View Tasks:**
    *   Your tasks will appear in the list below the input fields.

3.  **Mark as Done:**
    *   Select a task from the list.
    *   Click the "Mark as Done" button. The task will be updated to show "(Done!)".

## Project Structure

*   **`TaskManagerGUI.java`:** The main file containing the code for the GUI and task management logic.
*   **`Task.java` (Inner class):** A simple class to represent a task with its title, description, and completion status.

## Additional Notes

*   This project is a basic implementation and doesn't save tasks permanently. When you close the application, your tasks will be lost.
*   Feel free to customize and expand upon this project! You could add features like:
    *   Saving tasks to a file or database.
    *   Setting due dates for tasks.
    *   Prioritizing tasks.
    *   Filtering or sorting tasks.
*   Go Lakers!
